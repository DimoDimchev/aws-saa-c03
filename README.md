## This is a playground
I will be using this repository as a playground for experimentation with various AWS services while preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification(SAA-C03) Exam.

### Resources
- [This video](https://youtu.be/c3Cn4xYfxJY?si=9H9-Y-u3znwWZtGF) is the primary resource I will be using for preparing for the exam. Most if not all of the content in this repository will be from the follow-alongs showcased there.
- If you're also interested in sitting the SAA-C03 exam, you can check out TutorialsDojo for practice exams(they do a very good job to prepare you for the AWS exams)
